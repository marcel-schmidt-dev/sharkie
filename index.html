              <strong>Disclaimer:</strong><br /><br /><strong>Liability for Content</strong
              ><br /><br />
              The contents of our pages were created with the utmost care. However, we cannot
              guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or up-to-dateness of the content. As a service
              provider, we are responsible for our own content on these pages in accordance with § 7
              paragraph 1 DDG under general laws. According to §§ 8 to 10 DDG, however, we are not
              obligated as a service provider to monitor transmitted or stored third-party
              information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity.
              Obligations to remove or block the use of information under general laws remain
              unaffected. However, liability in this regard is only possible from the time of
              knowledge of a specific legal violation. Upon becoming aware of such legal violations,
              we will remove this content immediately.<br /><br />
              <strong>Liability for Links</strong><br /><br />
              Our offer contains links to external third-party websites over which we have no
              control. Therefore, we cannot assume any liability for these external contents. The
              respective provider or operator of the pages is always responsible for the content of
              the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the
              time of linking. Illegal content was not recognizable at the time of linking. However,
              permanent content control of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete
              indications of a legal violation. Upon becoming aware of legal violations, we will
              remove such links immediately.<br /><br />
              <strong>Copyright</strong><br /><br />
              The content and works created by the site operators on these pages are subject to
              German copyright law. Duplication, editing, distribution, and any kind of use beyond
              the limits of copyright law require the written consent of the respective author or
              creator. Downloads and copies of this site are permitted for private, non-commercial
              use only. Insofar as the content on this site was not created by the operator, the
              copyrights of third parties are respected. In particular, third-party content is
              marked as such. Should you nevertheless become aware of a copyright infringement,
              please inform us accordingly. Upon becoming aware of legal violations, we will remove
              such content immediately.<br /><br />
              <strong>Data Protection</strong><br /><br />
              The use of our website is generally possible without providing personal data. If
              personal data (e.g., name, address, or email addresses) is collected on our pages,
              this is always done on a voluntary basis, as far as possible. These data will not be
              passed on to third parties without your explicit consent.<br />
              We point out that data transmission over the Internet (e.g., communication by email)
              can have security vulnerabilities. A complete protection of the data from access by
              third parties is not possible.<br />
              The use of contact data published within the scope of the imprint obligation by third
              parties for sending unsolicited advertising and information materials is hereby
              expressly prohibited. The operators of the pages expressly reserve the right to take
              legal action in the event of unsolicited advertising information, such as spam
              emails.<br />
